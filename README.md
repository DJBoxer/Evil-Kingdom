 - Use the search engine to find out if a similar problem has been already reported. If so, check if it's already been fixed and waits for update.
 - Make sure, that what you report is actually a bug.

  * `[EN][Quest][Zone]` A Vision of the Past<br>
  * `[EN][NPC]` Thoralius the Wise<br>
  * `[EN][Spell][Class]` Frostfire Bolt<br>
  * `[EN][Glyph][Class]` Glyph of Frostfire Bolt<br>
  * `[EN][Npc][Drop]` Thoralius the Wise<br>
